abstract="We propose a novel constraint-based model to efficiently tackle the medical appointment sequence scheduling problem (MASSP), inspired by a real-world problem at Charit{\'e} -- Universit{\"a}tsmedizin Berlin. In many practical medical scenarios, scheduling a sequence of appointments, rather than a single appointment, has become increasingly essential for patients undergoing multi-stage treatments. The goal of the MASSP is to identify a set of medical resources with sufficient, consecutive, and available time slots in their calendars to create a sequence of appointments for effectively managing a treatment plan. The problem comprises various constraints, including the availability of both the intended patient and required medical resources, as well as the time and resource dependencies among the individual appointments that constitute the sequence. To address this, we formulate the problem as a constraint optimization problem ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}COP{\}}{\$}{\$}COP) that not only captures the basic constraints of the MASSP but also optimizes resource assignment to ensure a fair workload distribution within the medical facility. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the model performs effectively under diverse conditions, which confirms the utility and robustness of the proposed model in optimizing resource allocation and ensuring equitable workload distribution.",
